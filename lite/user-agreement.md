### 2. **No Medical or Therapeutic Applications**
- **Never use** for diagnosing mental health conditions
- **Never use** as replacement for professional psychological care
- **Never use** for therapeutic interventions or treatment planning
- If you need mental health support, consult qualified professionals

### 3. **No Personal Decision Making**
- Do not use CPF~ Lite outputs to make important life decisions
- Framework provides theoretical models, not practical advice
- Human judgment and professional consultation remain essential

### 4. **Research and Development Constraints**
- Framework is experimental and under development
- Results may be inconsistent or unexpected
- Validation studies are ongoing and incomplete

---

---

## üîí Privacy and Data Handling

### Data Processing
- CPF~ Lite processes input data locally for computational modeling
- No personal data is transmitted or stored outside the local environment
- Framework operates on theoretical scenarios and synthetic data

### Memory and Storage
- **Browser storage APIs are not supported** in the Claude.ai artifact environment
- All processing occurs in-memory during the session
- No persistent storage of user interactions or results

### Research Data
- If using CPF~ Lite for research, follow institutional data protection protocols
- Obtain appropriate ethical approval for any human subject research
- Anonymize and protect any research data according to applicable regulations

---

## üìã Ethical Use Guidelines

### Research Ethics
- Obtain institutional ethics approval before using in formal research
- Ensure informed consent for any research participants
- Follow disciplinary standards for computational cognitive research
- Report limitations and uncertainties in any research outputs

### Responsible Development
- Acknowledge the theoretical and experimental nature of the framework
- Avoid overstating capabilities or making unsupported claims
- Contribute to validation efforts through appropriate research channels
- Share findings with the research community appropriately

### Safety Considerations
- Monitor for any signs of harmful or concerning outputs
- Implement appropriate safeguards in research applications
- Report any safety concerns to relevant authorities

---

## üö´ Prohibited Uses

**The following uses are strictly prohibited:**

### Medical and Therapeutic
- Diagnosing mental health conditions
- Providing therapeutic interventions
- Replacing professional medical advice
- Creating medical assessment tools

### Personal Decision Making
- Making major life decisions based on framework outputs
- Financial planning or investment decisions
- Relationship or career guidance
- Legal or regulatory compliance decisions

### Harmful Applications
- Creating systems that could cause psychological harm
- Developing manipulative or deceptive technologies
- Building surveillance or control systems
- Any application that violates human rights or dignity

### Commercial Misuse
- Claiming CPF~ Lite provides "real" consciousness or understanding
- Marketing framework capabilities beyond their validated scope
- Selling services based on unvalidated theoretical models
- Misrepresenting research status or validation level

---

## üìñ Understanding Framework Outputs

### Probabilistic Nature
- All outputs are probabilistic variations, not deterministic predictions
- Same inputs will produce different but contextually coherent results
- Variation is a feature, not a bug - it models human cognitive uncertainty

### Interpretation Guidelines
- Treat outputs as theoretical models, not factual assessments
- Look for patterns across multiple runs rather than single results
- Consider outputs in context of cognitive science research
- Always maintain critical evaluation of results

### Validation Status
- Framework concepts are grounded in established research
- Specific implementations are experimental and unvalidated
- Ongoing research is needed to establish reliability and validity
- Results should not be considered scientifically established fact

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Mechanisms

CPF~ Lite includes several built-in safety mechanisms:

### Reality Engine Protection
- Continuous monitoring of processing coherence
- Automatic intervention when patterns become concerning
- Grounding in external reality through multiple anchor points
- Emergency circuit breakers for harmful processing loops

### Probabilistic Bounds
- All outputs are probabilistically bounded to reasonable ranges
- Extreme or concerning outputs are filtered and moderated
- System maintains coherence with established cognitive principles
- Built-in uncertainty quantification prevents overconfidence

### Meta-Cognitive Monitoring
- System monitors its own processing for quality and safety
- Automatic detection of concerning patterns or outputs
- Self-correction mechanisms for maintaining appropriate boundaries
- Continuous assessment of processing integrity

---

## üìû Support and Reporting

### Technical Support
- Framework documentation and examples provide primary support
- Community forums may be available for research collaboration
- Issues can be reported through appropriate research channels

### Safety Concerns
- Report any concerning outputs or behaviors immediately
- Contact relevant institutional authorities for safety issues
